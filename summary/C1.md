# Chapter 1 - Getting Started

This chapter introduces most of the basic elements of C++: types, variables, expressions, statements, and functions.
Along the way, we will briefly explain how to compile and execute a program.

## Writting a Simple C++ Program

Every C++ program contains one or more **function**, one of which must be named **`main`**. The operating system runs
a C++ program by calling `main`. 

```
int main()
{
	return 0;
}
```

A function definition has four elements: a **return type**, a **function name**, a (possibly empty) **parameter list**
enclosed in parentheses, and a **function body**.

When a `return` statement includes a value, the value returned must have a type that is compatible with the return type
of the function. 

Note the semicolon(;) at the end of the `return` statement. Semicolons mark the end of most statements in C++. They are
easy to overlook but, when forgotten, can lead to mysterious compiler error messages.

> **KEY CONCEPT: TYPES**

> **Types are one of the most fundamental concepts in programming and a concept that we will come back to over and over
in this Primer. A type defines both the contents of a data element and the operations that are possible on those data.**

> **The data our programs manipulate are stored in variables and every variable has a type. When the type of a variable
named `v` is `T`, we often say that "`v` has type `T`" or, interchangeably, that "`v` is a `T`."**
