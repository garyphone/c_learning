# Chapter 1 - Getting Started

This chapter introduces most of the basic elements of C++: types, variables, expressions, statements, and functions.
Along the way, we will briefly explain how to compile and execute a program.

## Writing a Simple C++ Program

Every C++ program contains one or more **function**, one of which must be named **`main`**. The operating system runs
a C++ program by calling `main`. 

```
int main()
{
	return 0;
}
```

A function definition has four elements: a **return type**, a **function name**, a (possibly empty) **parameter list**
enclosed in parentheses, and a **function body**.

When a `return` statement includes a value, the value returned must have a type that is compatible with the return type
of the function. 

Note the semicolon(;) at the end of the `return` statement. Semicolons mark the end of most statements in C++. They are
easy to overlook but, when forgotten, can lead to mysterious compiler error messages.

> **KEY CONCEPT: TYPES**

> **Types are one of the most fundamental concepts in programming and a concept that we will come back to over and over
in this Primer. A type defines both the contents of a data element and the operations that are possible on those data.**

> **The data our programs manipulate are stored in variables and every variable has a type. When the type of a variable
named `v` is `T`, we often say that "`v` has type `T`" or, interchangeably, that "`v` is a `T`."**

## A First Look at Input/Output

The C++ language does not define any statements to do input or output (IO). Instead, C++ includes an extensive **standard
library** that provides IO.

Most of the examples in this book use the **``*iostream* library. Fundamental to the `iostream` library are two types named
**`istream`** and **`ostream`**, which represent input and output streams. A stream is a sequence of characters read from
or written to an IO device.

**Standard Input and Output Objects**

The library defines four IO objects. To handle input, we use an object of type `istream` named **`cin`**. This object is also
referred to as the **standard input**. For output, we use an `ostream` object named **`cout`**. This object is also known as 
the **standard output**. The library also defines two other `ostream` objects, named **`cerr`** and **`clog`**. We typically
use `cerr`, referred to as the **standard error**, for warning and error messages and `clog` for general information about
the execution of the program.

**A Program That Uses the IO Library**

Using the IO library, we can extend our `main` program to prompt the user to give us two numbers and then print their sum:

```
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
	std::cout << "Enter two numbers:" << std::endl;
	int v1 = 0, v2 = 0;
	std::cin >> v1 >> v2;
	std::cout << "The sum of " << v1 << " and " << v2
			  << " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;
	return 0;
}
```

The first line of our program

```
#include <iostream>
```

tells the complier that we want to use the `iostream` library. The name inside angle brackets refers to a **header**.
Every program that uses a library facility must include its associated header. The `#include` directive must be written
on a single line - the name of the header and the `#include` must appear on the same line. In general, `#include` directives
must appear outside any function. Typcially, we put all the `#include` directives for a program at the beginning of the 
source file.

**Writing to a Stream**

The first statement in the body of `main` executes an **expression**. In C++ an expression yields a result and is composed
of one or more operands and (usually) an operator. The expressions in this statement use the output operator (the `<<` **
operator**) to print a message on the standard output:

```
std::cout << "Enter two numbers:" << std::endl;
```
